# JuniorGameProgrammerProject
This is the project I made during the Junior Programmer course on Unity Learn.
Move with the arrow keys and rotate the player with the mouse while holding down the right click button and moving the mouse left or right.
The object of the game is to collect all 3 treasure chests without getting hit by an enemy. If you get hit, the game is over. You can get a powerup for temporary invincibility if it appears (a gem).
To end the game, press ALT + F4.
